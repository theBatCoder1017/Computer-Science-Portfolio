        <p><strong>My hobbies include coding, chess, and baseball</strong></p>
        <p>I started coding in 6th grade.  Ever since then I have loved it.  Coding allows me to bring my imagination to life.</p>
        <p>I have wanted to play chess for a while, but have really just gotten into it.  I'm no grandmaster but I think I can hold my own.</p>
        <p>I have been playing baseball since 1st grade.  I play catcher, and have a batting average of 4.36.  That's pretty good.</p>
