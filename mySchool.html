        <p><strong>I go to Summit Denali middle school.</strong>  Summit Denali is one of several Summit schools that operate in California.</p>
        <p>Summit schools are fairly different than others.  This is because Summit schools encourage you to learn at your own pace.</p>
        <p>We also have better oppurtunities to learn such as taking computer science courses.  To learn, we use a tool called the PLP to choose subjects to learn.</p>
